Here’s where you stand — objectively.

---

## ✅ Core Implementation

You have:

* Maze generator (size + openness + seed) ✔
* DFS ✔
* BFS ✔
* A* (Manhattan + Euclidean) ✔
* Value Iteration ✔
* Policy Iteration ✔
* Shared path extraction ✔
* Clean modular structure ✔

That fully satisfies Parts 1–3 of the assignment.

---

## ✅ Experimental Infrastructure

You now have:

* Systematic experiment runner ✔
* Multiple sizes ✔
* Multiple seeds ✔
* Multiple openness levels ✔
* Unified metrics (`moves`, `runtime`, `work`, `memory`) ✔
* CSV export capability ✔

This is strong. Many students stop at “single maze comparison.”

## 🔄 What’s Missing

### 1️⃣ Analysis Layer

You haven’t yet:

* Aggregate results (mean/std across seeds)
* Generate plots
* Interpret scaling behaviour formally

That’s the big remaining block.

---

### 2️⃣ Structured Comparison Section

You’ll need to explicitly compare:

* Search vs Search
* MDP vs MDP
* Search vs MDP

But you now have the data engine to do that.

---

### 3️⃣ Interactive Demo UI

Still pending.
Low conceptual difficulty.
Engineering task.

---

## 📊 Overall Completion Estimate

Implementation: ~90% done
Experimental framework: ~70% done
Report-ready analysis: ~30% done
UI: 0%

But critically:

The hardest conceptual work is finished.

---

## 🔥 Big Picture

You are no longer “building algorithms.”

You are now in the:

> Data analysis + presentation + interpretation phase.

That’s a very different stage.

---

Tomorrow’s logical next move:

* Build plotting script
* Aggregate by size
* Produce first runtime vs size graph

Then things start looking like a proper AI report.

You’re in very good shape.
